## Agent Guidelines

Welcome! This repository requires thorough documentation to keep future AI and human contributors productive.

**When making changes:**
1. Add or preserve docstrings for every outward-facing function, method, and FastAPI route handler. Summaries should explain intent, inputs, and side effects concisely.
2. Prefer small, purposeful helper functions and keep inline comments focused on reasoning that is not obvious from the code.
3. Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` whenever you add, remove, or significantly change modules or cross-cutting flows so future agents can quickly orient themselves.
4. Keep code style simple—avoid unnecessary abstractions or speculative generalization. Clarity beats cleverness.

These instructions apply to the entire repository.
